### Meeting ~ (27 April 2020, about 2,5 Hours)
****
**Present:** Bora Altınok, Arda Tavusbay, Ali Eren Günaltılı, Ege Ergül, Berkay İnceişçi, Taha Batur Şenli  _**Absent:**_  

**Discussion:** 
We reviewed what we have done so far about our tasks. Bora managed to get started with Android Studio. He even designed a demonstration of sign up part of our app. He connected this small code to firebase with Ali Eren. Now we can sign up and our information can be stored on firebase (No objects are created though)! Meanwhile, Berkay and Ege focused on the design of our project. They design classes and methods that can be used if we were doing our app as a desktop app. It was beneficial for us to understand what classes we will need in the actual code (Android Studio). Taha focused on both firebase and git hub. He helped Eren to figure out the concept of firebase and also helped all of us to practice using git hub efficiently. Arda practiced XML further and created some of our app's pages on android studio. Now we have a couple of pages ready to go, we will add action listeners and other java code late on.

### Meeting ~ (30 April 2020, 1 Hour 15 Minutes)
****
**Present:** Bora Altınok, Arda Tavusbay, Ali Eren Günaltılı, Ege Ergül, Berkay İnceişçi, Taha Batur Şenli  _**Absent:**_  

**Discussion**
Today we discussed about the problems we encountered while using Android Studio, and tried to look for possible solutions as a group. We also decided on focusing more specific areas, such as designing and completing the gui, gathering more information on how we can create the required classes in Android Studio for our project. We divided our workload, and scheduled meetings for designing the code.

**ToDo:** 
This week we hope to make our app's log in/ sign up part on android Studio. This is essential and probably one of the most difficult part because we will need to generally construct most of the classes we have designed ( Customer class, AllCustomer Class...). We will try to store data on firebase as we log in. Once we can do this, we will finally have our first code including action listeners, java code, XML and firebase.

### Meeting ~ (3 May 2020, 1 Hour)
****
**Present:** Bora Altınok, Arda Tavusbay, Ali Eren Günaltılı, Ege Ergül, Berkay İnceişçi, Taha Batur Şenli  _**Absent:**_  

**Discussion**
In this meeting, we informed each other about what we have done so far and determined how we should proceed in the new week. Now we have a login screen in which the customers and restaurant owners are directed to the different pages according to how they are registered. Also, customers can now access to a transparent main menu by clicking on the option symbol, just as we indicated in our User Interface Report. We discussed how we should approach to the problem of connecting our app to real time - our app should somehow check the real time in order to control reservation durations. We ended the meeting by distributing tasks.

**ToDo:** 
This week we hope to finish reservation process, enabling all customers to reserve the time slot they desire and letting restaurant owners check and control the reservations made.
