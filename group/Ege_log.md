On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 28 April 2020 ~
This week, we started to the detailed design stage of our project. At first, it was challenging to shape some ideas on our minds since we did not have the adequate amount of information about FireBase and Android Studio, so we begin searching about them. My main focus was the android studio. I downloaded and installed Android Studio and made it work. It was challenging because of the speed of my computer and I had great difficulties with setting an emulator (virtual phone) to my PC. Afterward, I immediately started to practice on Android Studio. So far, I have managed to make a dead-simple calculator, but it was good for me to understand the basics of Android Studio. The other focus of mine this week was the design of our project. I tried to determine the classes &  possible methods by reading the previous reports of ours and formed a UML code for it. Then, I proposed my work to my team and we started to discuss it, our design has not been finalized yet but we made a great process. By the end of tonight, we will hopefully finalize it.
