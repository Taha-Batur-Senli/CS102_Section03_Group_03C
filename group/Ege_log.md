On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week, we started to the detailed design stage of our project. At first, it was challenging to shape some ideas on our minds since we did not have the adequate amount of information about FireBase and Android Studio, so we begin searching about them. My main focus was the android studio. I downloaded and installed Android Studio and made it work. It was challenging because of the speed of my computer and I had great difficulties with setting an emulator (virtual phone) to my PC. Afterward, I immediately started to practice on Android Studio. So far, I have managed to make a dead-simple calculator, but it was a good practice good for me to understand the basics of Android Studio. The other focus of mine this week was the design of our project. I tried to determine the classes &  possible methods by reading the previous reports of ours and formed a UML code for it. Then, I proposed my work to my team and we started to discuss it, our design has not been finalized yet but we made a great process. By the end of tonight, we will hopefully finalize it.

This week, Bora and I worked heavily on the skeleton of our apps. The first concern on ours was to connect our app to the firebase. There were two options: Authenticated firebase and Realtime database. It took a while for us to figure out that we did not need to select between two of them but instead we needed to implement both! We were so focused on selecting one of them that we skipped the ultimate truth and when eventually we saw our faulty point of view, I understood that the prerequisite for programming was to have a clear mindset. We have to look from different perspectives all the time. After finally creating the first user to our app and storing its data in both ways, we were challenged by several more problems. Manipulating firebase was not that simple (creating, reading updating, and deleting data) but somehow we did what we could and for now, everything is working. Now our app can sign up & login as both customer and restaurant owner. Two user profiles have two separate home pages and they can take several actions. Both customers and restaurants can display and edit their information at our database and log off. There are several more things that each profile can do but they are not finalized yet. We see that our app has some bugs: when you hit to the back button on the customer/restaurant home page, you are directed to the previous activity (either sign up or login activity) and you have to log in once more. Small bugs but needs to be fixed. Now, we will try to find the reasons why and try to fix them.

Since my last entry (only in 48 hours), a lot has changed. Firstly, I can say that we successfully fixed some bugs mentioned previously. There are only a few left. Yet, that is not what has changed. Bora and I did develop both profiles pages and the activities they can do. Up to a certain point, everything was working fluently. Then, I added a feature for restaurant owners to create a menu for their restaurants. They could add/edit their dishes. It was working too until we decided to add multiple dishes... At that point, I understood how fragile programming can be. It was a strange situation, when we tried to add the second dish, the program was shutting down itself. Yet, firebase was getting updated and after we logged in again, we could say that food was added. There was no reason for our code to be working and it created the illusion that we had "broken" the previously working code as well. After hours and hours of studying, I figured out that it was happening because we were trying to add food, not as an object, but instead, we were trying to add dishes' data(name, price, ingredients) as separate and multiple data. Bora and I immediately created a food class and it solved all of the problems. In the previous year, I had faced and fixed many errors but none of them was challenging and demotivating as this one. I, once more, realized that a programmer has to be open-minded all the time. We were looking for the error in wrong places, and when we started to look at correct places, we fixed the problem. Now, our team is experiencing other troubles with Git hub but I know that once we start looking from another perspective, we will solve the problem. My plan for the following days is to work with Berkay. We will try to integrate his work about making reservations to our skeleton we have designed with Bora. Hopefully, everything should end up well!
