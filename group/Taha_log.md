BAGELS! CROISSANTS! DRUMS! LET THE LOGS BE SHOWN!

On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 28.04.2020 ~
I created the GitHub repositories and created the necessary log files for all my teammates to use. Moreover, I acted like a liaison between different parts of the project (Firebase and Android Studio) and helped them accordingly during the creation of our report. In the report, where we tried to outline the classes and methods we planned to use, I contributed to the classes and methods corresponding to the login and sign up pages as well as the methods that would enable data storage.

### ~ 02.05.2020 ~
Today I brainstormed with Arda regarding how to use Android Studio and how to create the necessary pages for our project (including how to use GitHub best for creating the pages of our project). In the end, after much study, I began to work on the buttons on each page and began writing their java code (since the XML code only allows you to design the page) to make sure that the buttons forwarded the user to the correct pages. 

### ~ 03.05.2020 ~
Today was mostly spent on choosing the pages I wanted to start with and getting a clear idea of which page linked to which other page(s). I began to work on our main menu and mostly completed its appearance. I also had a short brainstorming session with Arda that helped me get a more clear idea on how to use the searchview.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
May the fourth be with you!

### ~ 05.05.2020 ~
Today I continued to wok on the GUI and kept designing the main menu and making sure the buttons on the completed pages were working properly. I learned how to use a ViewFlipper and applied it to the main menu successfully. The rest of my work time was spent on testing and brainstorming with the group on how the GUI would look. (Happy revenge of the fifth!)

### ~ 06.05.2020 ~
Today we experienced several problems with the GitHub repository we are using. Namely, we weren't able to push our changes to GitHub. In the end, we decided to reorganize the repository by moving all the code in the seperate branches to the master branch and I spent time trying to solve the main problem while also working on the GUI (main menu). In the end, me, Arda and Ege worked together to reorganize the main branch and we managed to combine the codes in the seperate branches into a single project which we uploaded to the master branch. With this somewhat painful but necessary reorganization process complete, I turned my attention back to the GUI.

### ~ 07.05.2020 and 08.05.2020 ~
These two days were mostly spent on working on the GUI. We had small brainstorming sessions with Arda, delegating the work while I completed my part on the main menu, passing it to Arda to make the necessary adjustments. From this moment on, my time will be dedicated to reviewing the pages we have made and gradually updating their appearance.

### ~ 09.05.2020 and 10.05.2020 ~
I spent the weekend overhauling the appearance of all the pages we have on the app and completed most of the changes for each page (adding background, buttons, adjusting the page format, fonts, text colors, outlines etc). My plan is to continue reworking the page appearances for the rest of the week and complete the whole ordeal by the end of the week. Moreover, I helped my teammates with any and all GitHub issues they encountered and helped them fix the necessary errors.

### ~ 10.05.2020 ~
Was a normal day spent with only a couple brainstorming sessions. All was quiet on the coding front, thankfully. (Plus, happy mother's day!)

### ~ 11.05.2020 and 12.05.2020 ~
These two days were straining, to say the least. However, I believe I have prevailed in the end. I began the second phase of my GUI reform plan by adding all the remaining backgrounds to the xml pages. Then, after fixing some of the GitHub problems my friends encountered, I reworked the pages they created by adjusting the fonts etc. and applied the appropriate constraints to them. Finally, after what felt like a perilous journey, I managed to update the ViewFlipper by fixing some of the issues we've encountered and added the "Welcome" text as well as the "SearchView" on top of it and made sure that this time they did not disappear when a new image appeared! I also contributed to our advanced report, albeit my contributions were mainly fluff-wise (such as the introduction) since I am on the GUI team. Finally, I brainstormed with my group on WhatsApp over a small issue we encountered, which was using the ListView since we couldn't figure out how to adjust it to our GUI due to design issues.

### ~ 14.05.2020 and 15.05.2020 ~
I spent these two days with continously working on the GUI and handling some of the minor issues the ViewFlipper caused. Moreover, I began working on the SearcView in order to make it funtion properly. In addition, I also experienced a major problem on Friday (15 March) and had to re-download the project after spending considerable amount of time trying to correct the issue.

### ~ 16.05.2020 and 17.05.2020 ~
Saturday was spent solving the previous issue and I managed to achieve success, while sunday was mostly spent on the SearchView. However, a small communications error in our team basically made my work on the SearchView obsolete and so I had to discard it and provide my understanding of it as advice. It was frustrating to discard my progress in a sense, but in the end we outlined our tasks clearly and so I began to work on designing the help pages.
