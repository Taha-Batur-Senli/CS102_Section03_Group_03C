BAGELS! CROISSANTS! DRUMS! LET THE LOGS BE SHOWN!

On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 28.04.2020 ~
I created the GitHub repositories and created the necessary log files for all my teammates to use. Moreover, I acted like a liaison between different parts of the project (Firebase and Android Studio) and helped them accordingly during the creation of our report. In the report, where we tried to outline the classes and methods we planned to use, I contributed to the classes and methods corresponding to the login and sign up pages as well as the methods that would enable data storage.

### ~ 02.05.2020 ~
Today I brainstormed with Arda regarding how to use Android Studio and how to create the necessary pages for our project (including how to use GitHuıb best for creating the pages of our project). In the end, after much study, I began to work on the buttons on each page and began writing their java code (since the XML code only allows you to design the page) to make sure that the buttons forwarded the user to the correct pages. 

### ~ 03.05.2020 ~
Today was mostly spent on choosing the pages I wanted to start with and getting a clear idea of which page linked to which other page(s). I began to work on our main menu and mostly completed its appearance. I also had a short brainstorming session with Arda that helped me get a more clear idea on how to use the searchview.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
May the fourth be with you!

### ~ 05.05.2020 ~
Today I continued to wok on the GUI and kept designing the main menu and making sure the buttons on the completed pages were working properly. I learned how to use a ViewFlipper and applied it to the main menu successfully. The rest of my work time was spent on testing and brainstorming with the group on how the GUI would look. (Happy revenge of the fifth!)

### ~ 06.05.2020 ~
Today we experienced several problems with the GitHub repository we are using. Namely, we weren't able to push our changes to GitHub. In the end, we decided to reorganize the repository by moving all the code in the seperate branches to the master branch and I spent time trying to solve the main problem while also working on the GUI (main menu). In the end, me, Arda and Ege worked together to reorganize the main branch and we managed to combine the codes in the seperate branches into a single project which we uploaded to the master branch. With this somewhat painful but necessary reorganization process complete, I turned my attention back to the GUI.

### ~ 07.05.2020 and 08.05.2020~
These two days were mostly spent on working on the GUI. We had small brainstorming sessions with Arda, delegating the work while I completed my part on the main menu, passing it to Arda to make the necessary adjustments. From this moment on, my time will be dedicated to reviewing the pages we have made and gradually updating their appearance.
