BAGELS! CROISSANTS! DRUMS! LET THE LOGS BE SHOWN!

On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 28.04.2020 ~
I created the GitHub repositories and created the necessary log files for all my teammates to use. Moreover, I acted like a liaison between different parts of the project (Firebase and Android Studio) and helped them accordingly during the creation of our report. In the report, where we tried to outline the classes and methods we planned to use, I contributed to the classes and methods corresponding to the login and sign up pages as well as the methods that would enable data storage.

### ~ 02.05.2020 ~
Today I brainstormed with Arda regarding how to use Android Studio and how to create the necessary pages for our project (including how to use GitHuıb best for creating the pages of our project). In the end, after much study, I began to work on the buttons on each page and began writing their java code (since the XML code only allows you to design the page) to make sure that the buttons forwarded the user to the correct pages.
