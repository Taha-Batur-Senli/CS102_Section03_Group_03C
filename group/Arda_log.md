On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### 28.04.2020
This week I was thinking of creating a neat and good-looking graphical user interface in the android studio. Few weeks ago, I've prepared a custom demo gui in the Adobe XD, and this week, especially today, I started implementing the gui to the android studio. I've implemented 3 pages (login page for both customer and restaurant owner, register page) to android studio so far, and I'm still trying to get used to the android studio. Other than implementation, I watched how people create apps using android studio, and tried to learn more about XML.

### 29.04.2020 / 30.04.2020
In these two days, I created a branch in github for uploading my code, for version control. I've edited the gui in terms of its fonts, text colors e.g. In addition, I've watched hundreds of app development tutorials on youtube, and studied Android Studio. As a result, I've managed to link the buttons so that they open the wanted pages (for example: register button in login page now navigates user to the register page). I'm currently working on creating the main menu page, with a button that will open up general options when pressed.

### 01.05.2020
Today I've created new activitiy pages for the gui, and implemented a demo menu system that shows the items in the menu and can also be scrolled down and up. I've learned how to create RecycleView and its classes in Android Studio.
@TODO: Enhance the menu system so that it fits the theme of the gui, create a navigate button to open an options panel, create more pages and complete the gui.

### 02.05.2020
Today I enhanced the menu system so that it now fits the theme of the GUI, created a settings option button to open an options panel, linked more buttons with their pages. 

### 02.05.2020 - 05.05.2020
In these 3 days, I've finished the menu system for customers, and added a new feature for restaurant owners so that they can now add dishes to their menu. In addition, we (me and Ali Eren) completed almost all of the GUI design, we only have 2-3 pages left while we've done approximately 19-20 pages. Other thing I worked on these days was implementing the design to the android studio java code that mainly Ege and Bora wrote. As a result, Log in and Register pages are now fully functioning and has their designs, almost finished.
