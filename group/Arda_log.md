On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### 28.04.2020
This week I was thinking of creating a neat and good-looking graphical user interface in the android studio. Few weeks ago, I've prepared a custom demo gui in the Adobe XD, and this week, especially today, I started implementing the gui to the android studio. I've implemented 3 pages (login page for both customer and restaurant owner, register page) to android studio so far, and I'm still trying to get used to the android studio. Other than implementation, I watched how people create apps using android studio, and tried to learn more about XML.

### 29.04.2020 / 30.04.2020
In these two days, I created a branch in github for uploading my code, for version control. I've edited the gui in terms of its fonts, text colors e.g. In addition, I've watched hundreds of app development tutorials on youtube, and studied Android Studio. As a result, I've managed to link the buttons so that they open the wanted pages (for example: register button in login page now navigates user to the register page). I'm currently working on creating the main menu page, with a button that will open up general options when pressed.

### 01.05.2020
Today I've created new activitiy pages for the gui, and implemented a demo restaurants' menu system that shows the items in the menu and can also be scrolled down and up. I've learned how to create RecyclerView and its classes in Android Studio.
@TODO: Enhance the menu system so that it fits the theme of the gui, create a navigate button to open an options panel, create more pages and complete the gui.

### 02.05.2020
Today I enhanced the menu system so that it now fits the theme of the GUI, created a settings option button to open an options panel, linked more buttons with their pages. 

### 02.05.2020 - 05.05.2020
In these 3 days, I've finished the menu system for customers, and added a new feature for restaurant owners so that they can now add dishes to their menu. In addition, we (me and Ali Eren) completed almost all of the GUI design, we only have 2-3 pages left while we've done approximately 19-20 pages. Other thing I worked on these days was implementing the design to the android studio java code that mainly Ege and Bora wrote. As a result, Log in and Register pages are now fully functioning and has their designs, almost finished.

### 05.05.2020 - 12.05.2020
This week I've designed and implemented almost all lists required for the GUI (RecyclerViews, Scrollviews, Listviews). I've added the settings menu that can be reached through menu button from any page. Now, every button in menu is functional. I've corrected the git repository with Taha and Ege so now every member works in the same project as a group (apparently we were using git incorrectly, and correcting it took a lot of time actually). I've further wrote java codes for GUI to work functionally, I've implemented the GUI on some of the pages, and most of the buttons, lists, any interactive items are now functional. Currently, I'm working with Ali Eren on restaurant owners uploading images, storing the images in firebase, and then calling & using these images dynamically in main menu under the all/best restaurants, promotions menu. 

@TODO: For now, when user wants to close the pop-up settings menu, it starts the previous activity over the pop-up settings menu instead of actually closing the pop-up settings menu with going back to the previous activity. I'll enhance the close button.
@TODO 2: I need to look at our main function: making reservations. Some of my team members especially Berkay was involved in making reservations, I will work with him to implement the features to the Android Studoio, to the GUI.
