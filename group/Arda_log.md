This week I was thinking of creating a neat and good-looking graphical user interface in the android studio. Few weeks ago, I've prepared a custom demo gui in the Adobe XD, and this week, especially today, I started implementing the gui to the android studio. I've implemented 3 pages (login page for both customer and restaurant owner, register page) to android studio so far, and I'm still trying to get used to the android studio.
