On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

Today, I thought a bit on outline of our project and made some additions-substractions to the scheme prepared by Ege. Then, I created user-costumer-restaurant owner classes and put some methods into them. In our app, customers and restaurants need to be ordered depending on their points or ratings for the reward purposes. At first, sorting all customers and restaurants whenever getBestCustomers or getBestRestaurants is called seemed appropriate and therefore I wrote these methods using quick sort. Then, I thought it would be better practice to update the place of customers or restaurants whenever their points or ratings are incremented. So I updated increasePoint method in the Customer class so that it updates the leaderboard whenever a customer makes a reservation and has an increase in their points (May seem simple, but it took approximately 3 hours to think and implement it). I will implement same approach to the restaurant rating system. Other than that, I'm still on the process of learning the basics of android studio and firebase.
