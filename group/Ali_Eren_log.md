On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week I learned to implement firebase to my android project by using realtime database. I also designed GUİ's of our projects with our friends on android studio and how to write it on xml's to manipulate the GUI. I also helped my friends to designed basic login and changeable then check the data via firebase.

 These days I and Arda worked on the GUI and we almost finished the basic design except 5 6 page. Also I started study on SQL to better understand the firebase mechanism. About GUI I learned create recylclerview and create scrollable page. In SQL I succeed to save my first data by creating table and updated. Other than that I realized that I made mistakes when I am making the constrain layout. I have to constrain images and textview related to each other instead of constrain them respect to the page.
