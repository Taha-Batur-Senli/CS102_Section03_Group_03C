On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week I learned to implement firebase to my android project by using realtime database. I also designed GUİ's of our projects with our friends on android studio and how to write it on xml's to manipulate the GUI. I also helped my friends to designed basic login and changeable then check the data via firebase.

### ~ 04.05.2020 ~
 These days I and Arda worked on the GUI and we almost finished the basic design except 5 6 page. Also I started study on SQL to better understand the database mechanism. About GUI I learned create recylclerview and create scrollable page. In SQL I succeed to save my first data by creating table and updated the data that I stored. Other than that I realized that I made mistakes when I am making the constrain layout. I have to constrain images and textview related to each other instead of constrain them respect to the parent.

 After I comprehend the logic of database and SQL I started work on firebase real time database. As I volunteered to do the drag dropping mechanism of our seating plan, I started to think how should I store the drag dropped images into firebase. I succeed to drag and drop a image to another image however it directly fill the whole size of the target image. Therefore, I wasted lots of time to keep the size of the dragged objects and couldn’t do it. After I realize our drag drop mechanism not very convenient and hard to interpret by code, I started to think a more convenient and feasible way. Eventually I found a way to do it. This way is very similar to choosing and uploading a picture to any social media account. This will be useful because restaurants can arrange their seating plan as they want. It also gives them a chance to upload the pictures of restaurants or meals. Simultenaously, I also helped Arda to creation of some GUIs of our project and started to working on some RecyclerViews by creating a class Adapter which represent a every row of the RecyclerView. After few days passed by watching tutorials about firebase database and create the logic in my mind. I have to store the url of the picture to show it on my screen so I have search the method and libraries for it. One library basically call “picasso” is very useful for this request. Picasso has a method to called “Picasso.with(Context).load(Image Url which is going to be loaded).into(target Place)” and this is what I need to show to image on my screen. I take notes about the needed methods and libraries to be used in uploadImage activity and give a break on that.  After that I spend my time on databases and started to working on SQL and firebase. But while I am learning more things about firebase, I realized that we don’t really need to write anything about SQL to store and retrieve data since firebase automatically do that for me. At this point as we are strugling with using gitHub properly I don’t have an direct access to my friends and still don’t know many things how they use the firebase on login sign up mechanism. Therefore, I also searched for the tutorial of building login sign up to decide what should do next to relate the datas each other.

 In these days we managed to use git properly. Therefore, I have an access to my friends code and by looking Ege and Bora loging mechanism I learned to implementation of FirebaseAuth and FirebaseUser to database. Basically I learned to build a bridge between datas and reach a specific data by referencing the right childs. I also start to design uploadImage activity. The intent that I used in chooser method passed it via “startActivityForResult” as I have to take the picture from B and receive the A. In a overrided OnActivityResult method I take the url of the chosen photo and displays it the choose/upload page. Then when the upload button is pressed save the data to firebase by creating upload object which has two properties url and name. However, I still couldn't manage the retrieve data yet. Other than that I worked on basic things like creating few help classes and dealing with some GUI problems.

  After I have managed to save the image to firestorage and the url and the name to real time database, now it is time start to show the uploaded ones as customers need to see restaurant’s photos. In this part, I thought for the gallery page recyclerview be better as restaurant may upload whatever they want. So first, I started to create my recyclerView and adapter. I create new activity and put it only recyclerView into the xml file. Then I have to decide my row’s. So I create layout source file without java code to decide the apperance of the every row. In this xml I used the cardView inside of the relativeLayout as this is the proper way to append rows into the recyclerView. To used my row layout source file I created the Adapter class which extends RecyclerView<ImageView.Holder>. In this way I can pass the appearance of the row into the recyclerView. After the appearance part is done the only problem is putting the image and related names into the rows. After I searched from internet and watch some tutorial about creation of recyclerView with images, I learned required methods. In an overrided onBindViewHolder method I have to past the current url and the name of the upload objects and then put it into the row orderly. After I have reach the current url of the image I have a chance to upload the desired row by using picasso library as I mentioned before. After the implementation of my adapter class is done, I create a new activity to show my uploaded pictures called ImageRecycler and inside of the ımageRecycler I create few instances one of them is Adapter objects for sure to get the picture and the name of the row. After this point, my job is simple to show to uploads, I am going to utilize the method belongs to recyclerView called setAdapter and passed my adapter into this method. Finally I succeed to see something when my ImageRecycler activity called. However, as I worked on the upload mechanism in a totally different project I still don’t know how to implement our main project. Therefore, I started to check my friends code in CustomerPovRestaurant and Menu classes since the logic is simple. One of them is going to show the related foods and description that belongs to restaurant, one of them going to show the related photos of the restaurant. Eventually I get the logic of my friends code and ready to implement my upload mechanism to our code.

   As I mentioned before I worked on my friends code to implement my mechanism. Before the customers perpective I have to store the data from restaurants accounts. I managed to do it by using FirebaseAuth and FirebaseUser and using getCurrentUser method. In this way I managed to store my data under the related child that my friend created on the firebase. At the very first step I have to decide the show uploads button place from the perspective of the customers and I decide it to put this button into right after the restaurant name is pressed in another word into the CustPOVRestaurant activity. The all process is going easier than I thought since my friends who worked on firebase Ege, Bora and Berkay already pass the clicked restaurant id’s into this class by using “intent.putExtra” method. Thanks to them it is easy to reach the desired child of the clicked restaurant. Other than that everything will be same since only different things is the path to reach the data. Of course it won’t happen in first time since I did some silly mistakes. Instead of using their final String which is already defined as “intent.getExtra” I create my own and passed to my ImageRecycler then the app is keep stopping due to NullPointerExpectation. I couldn’t understand it for a day but after I asked my friends to take advice I get the problem. Since there are few ways to reach the restaurant page from customer’s perspective, getting the “only intent.getExtra” from allRestaurants won’t be enough. Therefore, I used their variables in my mechanism too. Finally, I have succeed to show the uploaded pics of restaurants to customers. Then I have made few changes of the appearance of these activities and my row layout source file to make it look like belongs to our app.

   After I show the uploadImage mechanism to my friends, we all started to think about how can we make it better. So, my friend who worked on our project’s GUIs Arda mentioned about his ideas uploadImage and we started to working on. Arda suggested that separating uploadImage to three. First of them is uploadImage to gallery. This is going to be the random photos of the restaurants. Second of them is uploadSeatingPlan. Seating plan photos are precious for our app since they give a chance to customers to choose their table when they are making a reservations. Therefore, we illustrate the seating plan photos on the make reservation page as it is mostly related with it and in a way different than the normal photos of the restaurants. Other uploadImage mechanism is about to arranging the restaurant logo. Our goal is using the same mechanism of choose/upload but when the upload button is called it also put the uploaded picture and put it into the imageView which belongs to CustPOVRestaurant activity. Eventually, near the description logo will appear. After our brainstorming is done, we started to coding and creating ImageRecyclerSeatingPlan just similar to ImageRecycler. Main deal is actually saving the pictures to specific place when it is uploaded at the first place. So I added new three child called logo,seating plan and gallery. After I create three new child, I just changed the path in ImageRecycler and ImageRecyclerSeatingPlan. As logo going to be one picture it is way way easier than the others and any recyclereview or adapters required. Finally me and Arda managed to finish these three things and put the activities right place. After we fixed some GUI bugs our projects is finished.
